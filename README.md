Advent of Code 2016 (http://adventofcode.com/2016) personal exercises in Scala


For running these you need SBT (http://scala-sbt.org) installed. 
Main program is executed from within root directory. Type
`sbt "run 1"` to run first day's first part or `sbt "run 5b"` to run 2nd part of fifth day's task.
With `sbt "run all"` you can run all the tasks in one go.
